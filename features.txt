name idea: cocio
manage it's own internal state or be passed some state to apply rules to
be able to query internal state
take a script file to build the actual rules
take a file with condition names and their possible values or generate the possible values as the script file is processed
	- be able to toggle the dynamic value generation on/off
handle condition values being bool, string, int, float
some sort of linting prepass on the files script and condition files??

user requests for rule to be run, user end shouldnt care about how conditions are handled under the hood, can probably one to one map script file ifs to C code

script file contents:
	- if statements to turn into rules
	- if statement bodies to build rule results
